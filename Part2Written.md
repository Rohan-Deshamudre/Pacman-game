Exercise 9
- A flaky test is a test that passes sometimes and fails sometimes for the same configuration. There are several reasons why a test can be flaky.  

Exercise 10
- 100% code coverage is a good thing to have as it forces the testing of all the functions. It infers a certain level of quality in the tests and also usually leads to the improvement in quality of the whole software. However,having 100% code coverage does not mean the code that is being tested is bug free. It is possible to achieve 100% code coverage even if some of the tests are not the most meaningful. Too much importance should not be given to the code coverage percentage as this may force developers to write useless tests just for the sake of increasing coverage.
