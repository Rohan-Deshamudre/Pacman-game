Exercise 9
- A flaky test is a test that passes sometimes and fails sometimes for the same configuration. 

Exercise 10
- 100% code coverage is a good thing to have as it forces the testing of all the functions. 
However,having 100% code coverage does not mean the code that is being tested is bug free. It is possible to achieve 100% code coverage even if some of the tests are not the most meaningful.
